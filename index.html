Those hospitals that charge too much money and you don’t have insurance and they don’t accept you, I would change that —overnight.","Studs Terkel, Working: People Talk About What They Do All Day and How They Feel About What They Do, loc. 10760"],["The man kneels who’s settin’ the toilets in the restrooms. He’s got to kneel, that’s part of his work. The man who nails the pews on the floor, he had to kneel down. The man who put the receptacles in the walls that turn that I-don’t-know-how-many horsepower organ they got in that Riverside Church—that thing’ll blow you halfway to heaven right away, pow!—the man who was putting the wire in that thing, he kneeled down. Any work, you kneel down—it’s a kind of worship. It’s part of the holiness of things, work, yes. Just like drawing breath is. It’s necessary. If you don’t breathe, you’re dead. It’s kind of a sacrament, too.","Studs Terkel, Working: People Talk About What They Do All Day and How They Feel About What They Do, loc. 10979"],["But every once in a while there’s stuff that comes in on you. All of a sudden something falls into place. Suppose you’re driving an eight-penny galvanized finishing nail into this siding. Your whole universe is rolled onto the head of that nail. Each lick is sufficient to justify your life. You say, “Okay, I’m not trying to get this nail out of the way so I can get onto something important. There’s nothing more important. It’s right there.” And it goes—pow! It’s not getting that nail in that’s in your mind. It’s hitting it—hitting it square, hitting it straight.","Studs Terkel, Working: People Talk About What They Do All Day and How They Feel About What They Do, loc. 11007"],["This is the purpose of all Zen teaching—to make you wonder and to answer that wondering with the deepest expression of your own nature.","Shunryu Suzuki and David Chadwick, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind: Informal Talks on Zen Meditation and Practice, loc. 196"],["The practice of Zen mind is beginner’s mind. The innocence of the first inquiry—what am I?—is needed throughout Zen practice. The mind of the beginner is empty, free of the habits of the expert, ready to accept, to doubt, and open to all the possibilities. It is the kind of mind which can see things as they are, which step by step and in a flash can realize the original nature of everything.","Shunryu Suzuki and David Chadwick, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind: Informal Talks on Zen Meditation and Practice, loc. 201"],["The Zen way of calligraphy is to write in the most straightforward, simple way as if you were a beginner, not trying to make something skillful or beautiful, but simply writing with full attention as if you were discovering what you were writing for the first time; then your full nature will be in your writing. This is the way of practice moment after moment.","Shunryu Suzuki and David Chadwick, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind: Informal Talks on Zen Meditation and Practice, loc. 208"],["If your mind is empty, it is always ready for anything; it is open to everything. In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities; in the expert’s mind there are few.","Shunryu Suzuki and David Chadwick, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind: Informal Talks on Zen Meditation and Practice, pg. 2, loc. 297"],["This is also the real secret of the arts: always be a beginner. Be very very careful about this point. If you start to practice zazen, you will begin to appreciate your beginner’s mind. It is the secret of Zen practice.","Shunryu Suzuki and David Chadwick, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind: Informal Talks on Zen Meditation and Practice, pg. 2, loc. 308"],["When you do not try to attain anything, you have your own body and mind right here. A Zen master would say, “Kill the Buddha!” Kill the Buddha if the Buddha exists somewhere else. Kill the Buddha, because you should resume your own Buddha nature.","Shunryu Suzuki and David Chadwick, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind: Informal Talks on Zen Meditation and Practice, pg. 9, loc. 341"],["Just as for sitting, when we stand in the zendo we have some rules.

When the boss does something right, everyone will do everything right, and at the right time. That is the secret of Buddhism.","Shunryu Suzuki and David Chadwick, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind: Informal Talks on Zen Meditation and Practice, pg. 10, loc. 357"],["If you think, “I breathe,” the “I” is extra. There is no you to say “I.” What we call “I” is just a swinging door which moves when we inhale and when we exhale.","Shunryu Suzuki and David Chadwick, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind: Informal Talks on Zen Meditation and Practice, pg. 11, loc. 374"],["Because we enjoy all aspects of life as an unfolding of big mind, we do not care for any excessive joy.","Shunryu Suzuki and David Chadwick, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind: Informal Talks on Zen Meditation and Practice, pg. 19, loc. 472"],["Even though you are the worst horse you will get to the marrow of Zen.","Shunryu Suzuki and David Chadwick, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind: Informal Talks on Zen Meditation and Practice, pg. 24, loc. 526"],["When you are sitting in the middle of your own problem, which is more real to you: your problem or you yourself? The awareness that you are here, right now, is the ultimate fact. This is the point you will realize by zazen practice. In continuous practice, under a succession of agreeable and disagreeable situations, you will realize the marrow of Zen and acquire its true strength.","Shunryu Suzuki and David Chadwick, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind: Informal Talks on Zen Meditation and Practice, pg. 24, loc. 535"],["In your big mind, everything has the same value. Everything is Buddha himself. You see something or hear a sound, and there you have everything just as it is. In your practice you should accept everything as it is, giving to each thing the same respect given to a Buddha. Here there is Buddhahood. Then Buddha bows to Buddha, and you bow to yourself. This is the true bow.","Shunryu Suzuki and David Chadwick, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind: Informal Talks on Zen Meditation and Practice, pg. 29, loc. 590"],["For a mother with children, having children is nothing special.

In other words, just practice zazen in a certain posture. Do not think about anything. Just remain on your cushion without expecting anything. Then eventually you will resume your own true nature.

How we become enlightened was his main interest.","Shunryu Suzuki and David Chadwick, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind: Informal Talks on Zen Meditation and Practice, pg. 40, loc. 713"],["So the kind of practice we stress thus cannot become too idealistic. If an artist becomes too idealistic, he will commit suicide, because between his ideal and his actual ability there is a great gap. Because there is no bridge long enough to go across the gap, he will begin to despair. That is the usual spiritual way. But our spiritual way is not so idealistic. In some sense we should be idealistic; at least we should be interested in making bread which tastes and looks good! Actual practice is repeating over and over again until you find out how to become bread. There is no secret in our way. Just to practice zazen and put ourselves into the oven is our way.","Shunryu Suzuki and David Chadwick, Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind: Informal Talks on Zen Meditation and Practice, pg. 41, loc. 722"],["Do not be too interested in Zen. When young people get excited about Zen they often give up schooling and go to some mountain or forest in order to sit.
